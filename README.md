# michigan_stats
for code i wrote on the University's of Michigan program "Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python" within specialization "Statistics with Python"

what i got from weeks 1-2:
  1)Define a confidence interval
  2)Determine assumptions needed to calculate confidence intervals for their respective population parameter
  3)Calculate confidence intervals by hand for one population proportion, difference in two population proportions, one population mean, one population mean difference for paired data, and difference in population means for independent groups
  4)Demonstrate your understanding of confidence intervals by communicating statistical ideas clearly and concisely for a potential client
  5)Create confidence intervals in Python
